Parameters:

filesToRun - saves all the folders name (which require processing) in the path.
fileStartInd - always 3, since the first 2 files in filesToRun are system files so need to be skipped.
fileInd - Index that runs from fileStartInd through the number of files
scanLabel - saves the name of the file, for example: 'MousePre 0001'
xmlHeader - saves all the scan prefrences
pixX, pixY, pixY - pixel size of the scan
ascanAve - how many A scan avg where done
bscanAve - how many B scan avg where done
scanMode - Bscan, 3D, etc.
frames2Avg - [] for 2D, 6 for 3D
outputFrameNum -  1 for 2D, NumberofYpixels/6 for 3D

signalBuff - Raw OCT Intensity signal
bandBuff - 
rawSpeckVarBuff - speckle variance withthout any threshold
diffBuff - substracting the two bands and normalizing to 0-255
speckVarBuff - dspeckle variance after threshold
diffNormBuff - diffBuff divided by signalBuff

frameInd - 1 if outputFrameNum = 1 (we are in 2D), else runs on the 3D volume and averages each Bscan

interf - interferogram of each Bscan, after certain filter averaging
frames2process - [] to process all frames, else based on 3D volume
avgLogBscan - 20*log of the average of all the Bscan
numOfFrames - equals to bscanavg, how many B scan avg where taken
frameRange - array from 1:numOfFrames
linBscan - absolute value of the complex image of each Bscan, after filter averaging
apodization - reference arm signal for each Bscan (usually averaged to two dimensions)
timeStamp - saves the time the scan was taken

saveAlgoData - was originally set to 0; Orly: needed for creating algorithms for explaining the steps in the algorithm
kVect - version of the chirp_vect
balanceFuncName - 'balance.mat'
balanceEnable - probably means that if 1 - needs to balance the bands

BscanCpx - complex Bscan image (not averaged - all bscan exist)
BscanCpxNorm - complex Bscan image (not averaged - all bscan exist) but normalized
band1spatial - absolute Bscan image of band1 (not averaged - all bscan exist)
band2spatial - absolute Bscan image of band (not averaged - all bscan exist)
compoundImg - Image with the two bands (no substraction)
diffImg - it seems like this is the image that shows the substraction of the bands
balanceFunc - from SpectralParam
h - saves 4 figures showing the bands results
