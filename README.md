# OCT_Reconstruction_and_Spectral_Analysis
A code for reconstruction and spectral analysis of spectral domain OCT images. This code can be used as part of a platform for molecular imaging with OCT, which we call MOZART.

This is a subversion of Orly Liba's code, with a few added functionallities, documentation and more.
